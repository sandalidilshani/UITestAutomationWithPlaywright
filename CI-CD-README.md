# Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

This document describes the enhanced CI/CD pipeline setup for the UI Automation project, designed to run without Docker while providing comprehensive testing, security, and deployment capabilities.

## üöÄ Pipeline Overview

The enhanced CI/CD pipeline consists of multiple specialized workflows that work together to ensure code quality, security, and reliable deployments.

### Workflow Files

1. **`.github/workflows/playwright.yml`** - Main CI/CD Pipeline
2. **`.github/workflows/notifications.yml`** - Enhanced Notifications
3. **`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`** - Security Scanning
4. **`.github/workflows/performance-tests.yml`** - Performance Testing
5. **`.github/workflows/code-quality.yml`** - Code Quality Analysis

## üìã Main Pipeline Features

### 1. Pre-checks and Validation
- Package.json validation
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Code linting (if configured)
- Dependency validation

### 2. Dependency Management
- Cached npm dependencies for faster builds
- Cached Playwright browsers
- Optimized installation process

### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: Basic unit testing framework
- **E2E Tests**: Matrix testing across browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- **Performance Tests**: Load, stress, and memory testing
- **Sharding**: Tests split across multiple runners for parallel execution

### 4. Security Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secret detection
- Code security analysis
- Hardcoded credential detection

### 5. Code Quality
- ESLint configuration and execution
- Prettier code formatting
- Complexity analysis
- Test coverage reporting

### 6. Deployment Stages
- **Staging**: Automatic deployment on `develop` branch
- **Production**: Automatic deployment on `main` branch
- Environment-specific configurations

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set these secrets in your GitHub repository settings:

```bash
# Notification Webhooks
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL=https://outlook.office.com/webhook/...
EMAIL_NOTIFICATIONS=your-email@example.com

# Application Configuration
BASE_URL=https://automationteststore.com
LOGIN_USERNAME=your-username
LOGIN_PASSWORD=your-password
```

### Performance Thresholds

The pipeline uses configurable thresholds:

```bash
PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD_MS=5000    # Page load time threshold
MEMORY_THRESHOLD_MB=100          # Memory usage threshold
```

## üéØ Trigger Events

### Automatic Triggers
- **Push to main/develop**: Full pipeline execution
- **Pull Requests**: Quality checks and testing
- **Scheduled**: Nightly security and performance tests

### Manual Triggers
- **Workflow Dispatch**: Run specific pipeline stages
- **Custom Parameters**: Choose environment, test types, etc.

## üìä Reporting and Notifications

### Test Reports
- HTML reports with screenshots and videos
- Artifact retention (7-90 days based on type)
- Comprehensive failure analysis

### Notifications
- **Slack Integration**: Real-time failure notifications
- **Microsoft Teams**: Deployment status updates
- **Daily Summaries**: Automated daily reports
- **Custom Alerts**: Security and performance alerts

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

### Testing
```bash
npm run test                 # Run all tests
npm run test:headed         # Run tests in headed mode
npm run test:ui             # Run tests with UI
npm run test:debug          # Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:report         # Show test report
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run lint                # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix           # Fix linting issues
npm run format             # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check       # Check code formatting
npm run quality:all        # Run all quality checks
```

### Security
```bash
npm run security:audit     # Run security audit
npm run security:fix       # Fix security issues
```

### Coverage
```bash
npm run coverage           # Run tests with coverage
```
